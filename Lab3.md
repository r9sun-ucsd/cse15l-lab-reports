# Lab Report 3  
This lab report will be investigating the command grep, and certain functions and parts of that command.  
The commands we'll be looking at are the commands: -i, -n, -w, and -h.  

Note: The source for all the following commands was found using this [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/). Also the fact that these test are being run in the technical/ directory.  
  
-w flag: It is a command that prints the lines that match the argument passed only if that line has the whole word on it.
The following are examples showing the -w flag.  

  
-n flag: 
The following are examples showing the -n flag.

-h flag: 
The following are examples showing the -h flag.

-i flag: The -i means that when grep is looking to match lines, the case of the desired argument in the file being searched does not matter when printing. It enables the printing of lines that have the same characters and keywords/phrases matching, without woring about upper/lowercase.  
The following are examples showing the -i flag.  
Example 1-  
```  
Code: 
grep -i "among" plos/journal.pbio.0020001.txt
